Calculated important metrics such as count of employees, attrition count, attrition rate, average employee rate, average salary, and average years spent at the company. 

# Key observations & insights:

1. Attrition by education: Life sciences and medical sector show the highest attrition, which could be due to lower compensation for workers and higher work hours. Attrition rate can help HR professionals in understanding employee retention and identify potential issues with employee engagement or satisfaction.
  
2. Attrition by age: People between the ages of 26-35 have shown the highest attrition rate. Employees in this age group are often at a point where they're actively thinking about career progression. Companies can strive to lower attrition in this age group by improving work-life balance, offering more career development opportunities, or re-evaluating compensation packages for those age groups.

4. Attrition by salary: Employees earning upto 5K show the highest attrition. Business organization should aim to restrucure their compensation programs.

5. Attrition by years at company: Employees who have spent 1 year at the company show the highest attrition. Additionally, on an average employyes also exit the company after spending 5 or 10 years at the company. High attrition within the first year suggests that employees may be facing issues with onboarding, job expectations, or cultural fit, indicating a need for improved early-stage integration and support. Conversely, attrition after 5 or 10 years often points to career stagnation, lack of growth opportunities, or compensation dissatisfaction, signaling the importance of offering continuous career development, competitive pay, and work-life balance options to retain long-term employees.

6. Attrition by job satisfaction: Employee who rate job satisfaction as 3 and 1 show some of the highest attrition rate. Employees who rate their satisfaction as 3 (neutral) or 1 (very dissatisfied) show the highest attrition rates because 3-rated employees are disengaged and likely to leave for better opportunities, while 1-rated employees are actively unhappy but may delay their exit until they find a new role. This highlights the importance of addressing both neutral disengagement and dissatisfaction through targeted engagement initiatives and problem-solving to prevent turnover.
